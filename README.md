# Are We There Yet? (not available on the App StoreÂ®)
Are We There Yet is an app for iOS that utilizes geofence tracking to alert the user when they are there.

# Details
This app is very simple. It consists of two view controllers: one to show the user their location (using MapKit), and another for the user to set up their notification. It's pretty easy to use. 

# Current Status
There are a few bugs I need to iron out, but the code works at the moment, which is good.

# Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why does your app only support the metric system?
A: Because noboby except Americans and old British people like to use miles, feet, etc.

Q: Can I make more than one geofence notification in this app?
A: Not right now, but the code does allow you to.

Q: Why do I keep getting notifications from the same geofence?
A: Because I haven't figured out how to make them automatically delete themselves yet. If you decide you want to be helpful and stop complaining, feel free to submit a suggestion using GitHub's built-in features! :^)
