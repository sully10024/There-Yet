# Are We There Yet?
Are We There Yet is an app for iOS that utilizes geofence tracking to alert the user when they are there.

# Details
This app is very simple. It consists of two view controllers: one to show the user their location (using MapKit), and another for the user to set up their notification. It's pretty easy to use. 

# Current Status
There are a few bugs I need to iron out, but the code works at the moiment, which is good.
