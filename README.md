# Are We There Yet?
Are We There Yet is an app for iOS that utilizes geofence tracking to alert the user when they are there.

# Details
This app is very simple. It just does what it says it does in the description. Not much to it. It also doesn't send your data to the NSA (at least, not the way I coded it. I can't promise you 100% that Apple doesn't have a deal with the NSA because I'm pretty sure they do. anyway....)

# Current Status
Everything works! Enjoy!

I plan on adding some new features down the line, as well.
