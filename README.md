# Are We There Yet?
Are We There Yet is an app for iOS that utilizes geofence tracking to alert the user when they are there.

# Details
This app is very simple. It consists of two view controllers: one to show the user their location (using MapKit), and another for the user to set up their notification. It's pretty easy to use. 

# Current Status
As of right now, this app encounters a run-time error when trying to add a geofence notification (geotification).
In other words, don't try to run it on your device, because it doesn't work.
